<p style="font-size:30px"><b> Summer 2021 research internship</b></p>
<p/> We are actively looking for undergraduate interns to join our lab for the summer of 2021.
If you are an undergraduate student at a university in Korea interested in doing exciting
research on robot intelligence, please <a href = "mailto: beomjoon.kim@kaist.ac.kr"> send me an email</a>
with your CV and any resource that describes the most interesting thing you have built (a Github repo, research paper,
video of the robot you have built, etc). Normally I would be happy to advise students from abroad,
but with the current COVID situation getting a Korean visa is extremely difficult.
</p>

<p>
<b> What would I work on?</b>
Our lab's goal is to build an intelligent mobile manipulator that can operate in unstructured environments.
For example, we want our robot to perform tasks like tidying up a living room, help with construction, or
more humbly, move a set of objects from one location to another among clutter.
  This requires an integrated system that includes
  perception, planning, and control algorithms. You will be contributing to creating this intelligent robot system.
</p>

<p>While we encourage students to propose their own research ideas, here are some potential list of projects:
  <br> 1. Learning to generate 3D scenes
  <br> 2. Interactive perception for object recognition
</p>
<p>
  See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1moS1sfspN_aUeR7tvEYUCGNDSlVEzHGZz2QgTqcLuBs/edit"> details </a>
for the detailed project descriptions.
</p>
<p>


<p>
<b> Can I work on reinforcement learning?</b>
  While we make significant use of machine learning, I believe plain RL is not a very effective way to build an
  intelligent robot. However, if you are passionate about working on RL for robotics, then please send a single
  page document describing your idea, and why RL would be necessary. If you can convince me the importance of your
  idea and the rationale behind using RL, I would be happy to work with you on an RL project.
</p>


<p>
  <b> What background do I need to do robotics research?</b>
Our lab members have diverse backgrounds - mathematics, EE, CS, and ME, to name a few. That being said,
  we do not select candidates based on their background. I believe if you are determined and passionate, you can always
  grab necessary materials as you go.
</p>

<p>
<b> How long is the internship?</b>
We are looking for someone who can commit full-time (40 hours per week) at least for 8 weeks.
</p>

<p>
<b> Where is the lab?</b>
We are located in <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/html/kaist/01200203.html"> KAIST Seoul campus</a>.
